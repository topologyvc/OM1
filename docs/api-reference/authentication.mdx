## API Keys

OpenMind requires an API key to authenticate requests. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an account on the OpenMind platform. The API key must be included in the `Authorization` or `x-api-key` header of each request, used to authenticate your requests and track usage quota.

**Keep your API key confidential**. Never share it with others or expose it in client-side code, such as browsers or apps.

Remember to include your API key in the `Authorization` or `x-api-key` header of each request. For example:

```http x-api-key
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
```http Authorization
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

For websocket connections, include the API key in the query string. For example: `wss://api.openmind.org?api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>`
