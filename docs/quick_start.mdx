title: Quick Start

This basic agent uses webcam data to estimate your emotion, generates a dummy VLM caption (*DUMMY VLM - FAKE DATA - I see {random_int_num} people. Also, I see a rocket.*), looks up an Ethereum wallet balance, and sends those inputs to a central LLM `OpenAI 4o`. The LLM then returns `movement`, `speech`, and `face` commands, which are displayed in `RacoonSim`, a small `pygame` window. `RacooonSim` also shows basic timing and other debug information.

**NOTE**: The simulator shows you generated speech, but does not send anything to your computer's audio hardware, reducing the need for you to install audio drivers.

## Installation

1. Install the Rust python package manager `uv`:

```bash install uv
# for linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# for mac
brew install uv
```

2. Clone the repo

```bash clone repo
git clone https://github.com/OpenmindAGI/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
uv venv
```

3. Set up environment and configuration variables

Add your Openmind API key in `/config/spot.json`. You can obtain an free Openmind access key at http://openmind.org/free. If you leave the placeholder, `openmind-free`, you may be rate limited.

```bash set api key
# /config/spot.json`
...
"api_key": "openmind-free"
...
```

4. Run Spot, a `Hello World` agent

```bash run spot
uv run src/run.py spot
```

Add ` --debug` to see more logging information.

<Tip>`uv` does many things in the background, such as setting up a `venv` and downloading any dependencies if needed. Please add new dependencies to `pyproject.toml`.</Tip>
<Note>If you are running complex models, or need to download dependencies, there may be a delay before the agent starts.</Note>
<Note>There should be a `pygame` window that pops up when you run `uv run src/run.py spot`. If you do not see `RacoonSim`, the window might be hidden behind all your other open windows - use "show all windows" (or equivalent) to find it.</Note>
