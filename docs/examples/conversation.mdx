This example uses your `default` audio in (microphone) and your `default` audio output (speaker). Please test both your microphone and speaker in your system settings to make sure they are connected and working.

```bash Conversation
uv run src/run.py conversation
```

You will be able to speak to the LLM, and it will generate voice outputs.

## Hardware audio drivers

On Mac and Linux, you may need to install `portaudio`.

For Mac:
```bash Mac Audio Drivers
brew install portaudio
```

For Linux:
```bash Linux Audio Drivers
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
```
